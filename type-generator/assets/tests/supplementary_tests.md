# We gather supplementary tests here which will later be proposed to the CSAF TC to incorporate in the csaf repository.

Rules for naming:
- don't use OASIS CSAF prefix or namespace
- use `s` for the test case to indicate supplementary tests
- use the same counting schema as for the original tests, i.e. even numbers in decade indicates invalid cases
